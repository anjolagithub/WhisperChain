Here's a concise README for your project, **WhisperChain**, that you can use on GitHub:

# WhisperChain

WhisperChain is a decentralized, private messaging app built on the blockchain. It ensures secure, peer-to-peer communication, offering encrypted messages, EIP-712 signature-based authentication, and nonce protection to prevent replay attacks. WhisperChain leverages blockchain technology to provide immutable, transparent, and tamper-proof messaging, giving users full control over their data and communications.

## Features

- **Private Messaging**: Send encrypted messages directly to other users.
- **Decentralized**: Built on the blockchain, no centralized authority.
- **EIP-712 Authentication**: Secure user authentication with signed messages.
- **Nonce Protection**: Prevent replay attacks with a nonce-based mechanism.
- **Transparency**: Blockchain ensures transparency and tamper-proof communication.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development for Ethereum-compatible blockchains.
- **EIP-712**: For structured data signatures and secure user authentication.
- **OpenZeppelin**: For reusable and secure smart contract components (e.g., `Ownable`).
- **Forge**: Testing framework for Solidity.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WhisperChain.git
   cd WhisperChain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contract to a testnet (or mainnet):

   ```bash
   forge create src/WhisperUser.sol:WhisperUser --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> --private-key <your_private_key>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Register Users**: Admin can register users on the platform.
2. **Authenticate Users**: Users authenticate themselves with their signature, using a nonce to prevent replay attacks.
3. **Send Messages**: Once authenticated, users can securely send encrypted messages to each other.

## Testing

1. To run tests, use Forge:

   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

   This will test the functionality of the smart contracts, including user registration and authentication.
